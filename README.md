# Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases helps you build better models faster with a central dashboard for machine learning projects. Use our tools to log hyperparameters and output metrics from your runs, then visualize and compare results and quickly share findings with your colleagues.

## Getting Started

Easily add our Python library `wandb` to your machine learning script.

* [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
* [Keras integration](guides/integrations/keras.md)
* [PyTorch integration](guides/integrations/pytorch.md)
* [TensorFlow integration](guides/integrations/tensorflow.md)
* [Jupyter notebook integration](guides/integrations/jupyter.md)

Here's a sample screenshot from a [Species Identification project](https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/curr_learn/reports?view=stacey%2FSpecies%20Identification) in W&B.

# PyTorch Lightning

PyTorch Lightning provides a lightweight wrapper for organizing your PyTorch code and easily adding advanced features such as [distributed training](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_gpu.html) and [16-bit precision](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/amp.html). W&B provides a lightweight wrapper for logging your ML experiments. We're incorporated directly into the PyTorch Lightning library, so you can always check out [their documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/generated/pytorch_lightning.loggers.WandbLogger.html#pytorch_lightning.loggers.WandbLogger) for the API and reference info.

## âš¡ Get going lightning-fast with just two lines:

```python
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger  # newline 1
from pytorch_lightning import Trainer

wandb_logger = WandbLogger()  # newline 2
trainer = Trainer(logger=wandb_logger)
```

## Check out **real** examples!

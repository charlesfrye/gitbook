# OpenAI Gym

If you're using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) we will automatically log videos of your environment generated by `gym.wrappers.Monitor`. Just set the **monitor\_gym** keyword argument to `wandb.init` to True or call `wandb.gym.monitor()`.

Our gym integration is very light. We simply [look](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/94c226afc4925535e6301c9bc9b9ee36061d99d4/wandb/integration/gym/__init__.py#L15) at the name of the video file being logged from `gym` and name it after that or fall back to "videos" if we don't find a match. If you want more control, you can always just manually [log a video to wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log#log-a-video).

Here's a small example project using the OpenAI Gym to play Snake: [https://github.com/Xyzrr/rl-snake](https://github.com/Xyzrr/rl-snake)

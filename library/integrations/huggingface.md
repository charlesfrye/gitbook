# Hugging Face

[Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) provides general-purpose architectures for Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) and Natural Language Generation \(NLG\) with pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

To get training logged automatically, just install the library and log in:

```text
pip install wandb
wandb login
```

The `Trainer` or `TFTrainer` will automatically log losses, evaluation metrics, model topology and gradients.

Advanced configuration is possible through [wandb environment variables](https://docs.wandb.com/library/environment-variables).

Additional variables are available with transformers:

        <ul>
          <li><b>gradients</b> (default): Log histograms of the gradients</li>
          <li><b>all</b>: Log histograms of gradients and parameters</li>
          <li><b>false</b>: No gradient or parameter logging</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">WANDB_DISABLED</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><em><b>boolean</b>:</em> Set to <b>true</b> to disable logging entirely</td>

### Examples

We've created a few examples for you to see how the integration works:

* [Run in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NEiqNPhiouu2pPwDAVeFoN4-vTYMz9F8?usp=sharing): A simple notebook example to get you started
* [A step by step guide: ](https://app.wandb.ai/jxmorris12/huggingface-demo/reports/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Tracking-Hugging-Face-Model-Performance--VmlldzoxMDE2MTU)track your Hugging Face model performance
* [Does model size matter?](https://app.wandb.ai/jack-morris/david-vs-goliath/reports/Does-model-size-matter%3F-A-comparison-of-BERT-and-DistilBERT--VmlldzoxMDUxNzU) A comparison of BERT and DistilBERT

### Feedback

We'd love to hear feedback and we're excited to improve this integration. [Contact us](../../company/getting-help.md) with any questions or suggestions.

## Visualize Results

Explore your results dynamically in the W&B Dashboard. It's easy to look across dozens of experiments, zoom in on interesting findings, and visualize highly dimensional data.

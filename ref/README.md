# Reference Docs

This section of the documentation site contains automatically-generated reference documentation for two major components of the W&B toolkit:

* the [Command Line Interface](cli/), for interacting with W&B via the shell, and
* the [Python Library](python/), for integrating W&B with your machine learning code.

We also document our [Java Library](java/), which is in beta.

For usage examples, including scripts, interactive colabs, and videos, see [our examples repo on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/examples).

For tutorials, guides, and FAQs, see the other sections of this website.

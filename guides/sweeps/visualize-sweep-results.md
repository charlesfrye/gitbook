Parallel coordinates plots map hyperparameter values to model metrics. They're useful for honing in on combinations of \_\*\*\_hyperparameters that led to the best model performance.

## Hyperparameter Importance Plot

The hyperparameter importance plot surfaces which hyperparameters were the best predictors of, and highly correlated to desirable values for your metrics.

**Correlation** is the linear correlation between the hyperparameter and the chosen metric \(in this case val\_loss\). So a high correlation means that when the hyperparameter has a higher value, the metric also has higher values and vice versa. Correlation is a great metric to look at but it canâ€™t capture second order interactions between inputs and it can get messy to compare inputs with wildly different ranges.

Therefore we also calculate an **importance** metric where we train a random forest with the hyperparameters as inputs and the metric as the target output and report the feature importance values for the random forest.

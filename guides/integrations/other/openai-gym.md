# OpenAI Gym

If you're using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) we will automatically log videos of your environment generated by `gym.wrappers.Monitor`. Just set the `monitor_gym` keyword argument to [`wandb.init`](../../../ref/python/init.md) to `True` or call `wandb.gym.monitor()`.

Our gym integration is very light. We simply [look at the name of the video file](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/integration/gym/__init__.py#L15) being logged from `gym` and name it after that or fall back to `"videos"` if we don't find a match. If you want more control, you can always just manually [log a video to wandb](../../track/log/media.md).

Here's a small example project using the OpenAI Gym to play Snake: [https://github.com/Xyzrr/rl-snake](https://github.com/Xyzrr/rl-snake)
